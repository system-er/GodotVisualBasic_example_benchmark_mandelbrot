# GodotVisualBasic_example_benchmark_mandelbrot     
benchmark painting a mandelbrot with gdscript, VisualBasic and C#.      
so VisualBasic is as fast as C# only the tunneling through C# cost us some milliseconds -    
but 30times faster than gdscript.    


gdscript(red), VisualBasic(green), C#(blue):
