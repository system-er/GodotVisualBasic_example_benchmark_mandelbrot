# GodotVisualBasic_example_benchmark_mandelbrot     
benchmark painting a mandelbrot with gdscript, VisualBasic and C#.

results on my old PC:    
- VisualBasic - 149 ms    
- C# - 134 ms    
- gdscript - 4822 ms    
so VisualBasic is as fast as C# only the tunneling through C# cost us some milliseconds - but 30times faster than gdscript. And its compiled.


gdscript(red), VisualBasic(green), C#(blue):
