# Godot_example_benchmark_mandelbrot     
benchmark painting a mandelbrot with gdscript, VisualBasic, C# and F#.     
so VisualBasic is as fast as F# and C# only the tunneling through C# cost us some milliseconds -    
but the three are 30times faster than gdscript.    

tested with Godot_v4.3-stable_mono_win64    
for GodotVisualBasic https://github.com/system-er/GodotVisualBasic    
for GodotFSharp https://github.com/system-er/GodotFSharp    
    

gdscript(red), VisualBasic(green), C#(blue), F#(bottomright normal colors):
