# Godot_example_benchmark_mandelbrot     
benchmark painting a mandelbrot with gdscript, VisualBasic, C# and F#.     
so VisualBasic is as fast as C# only the tunneling through C# cost us some milliseconds -    
but 30times faster than gdscript.    
New number One now with F# and on my computer F# is the fastest!(also see https://github.com/system-er/GodotFSharp)    
1: F#    
2: C#    
3: VisualBasic    
4: 30 times slower ... gdscript    
    

gdscript(red), VisualBasic(green), C#(blue), F#(bottomright normal colors):
